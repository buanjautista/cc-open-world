## Starter info ##

There's a few important story-tied events that change in order to make Open World have a little more freedom. The content can be done in any order and shouldn't be tied to doing most events in story order, at least per area. 

# Important changes #
- Vermillion Wasteland is open as soon as you gain access to Sapphire Ridge. The passage is on the Old Dojo right side, where the hidden passage is normally. If you're using the Meteor Shade Wasteland lock, you'll also need that shade to get there. 
- To unlock the Guild Area, you will need to get a D-Link (from Emilie or Schneider), after obtaining the Mine Pass. This makes him (and Emilie if she's not in your party) appear in Old Obelisk in Autumn's Rise, who gives you the item check for the Guild Pass, which also enables access to the Guild Area.
- Temple Mine only needs Mine Pass to enter, and isn't tied to meeting with the guild.
- Maroon Tree requires meeting with the Eldress in Ba'kii Kum, obtaining the Maroon Tree Pass, and inviting C'tron in your party (which you can invite after speaking with the Eldress, or meet with him in the usual map).
- Rhombus Square will be accessible through CrossCentral, as soon as you obtain Meteor Shade.
- Old Hideout is always accessible on the Northern Sapphire Ridge, as long as you have Meteor Shade, and no members in your party. This is only to obtain Shizuka as a party member / contact.
- To enter Old Dojo, you need to have the Golden Bugs quest started, and the Key to grant access to it.
- Vermillion Tower will be open by default, unless you're using the Shade Lock patch that adds 2 barriers there that require killing specific 4 bosses and getting 4 specific shades. 
- The Sneak section on Vermillion only gives one chest, and can't access Vermillion Tower area through there.

Certain quests will be tied to getting shades instead of dungeon progress. This is:
- Getting Red Flame Shade to unlock the third set of quests in Rookie Harbor, and the second set of quests in Ba'kii Kum
- Getting Blue Ice Shade to unlock the second set of quests in Bergen Village
- Getting Red Flame Shade and Blue Ice Shade for Master Sensei quests in Rookie Harbor Info Hub

# Extra Patches #
These are small patches that you can add to your runs, to slightly modify some places in order to add more variety to the Open World. You can activate these patches from the Randomizer menu in CCItemRandomizer, or through the .yaml settings in the CCMultiworldRandomizer

## Vermillion Tower Shade and Boss lock:
- A condition that locks Vermillion Tower entrance until you get all 4 element shades (Azure Drop, Purple Bolt, Blue Ice, and Red Flame Shades), and beaten the 4 element dungeons (Mine, Faj'ro, So'najiz and Zir'vitar).

## Vermillion Tower floor skips:
- Enables all Tower floors once you finish the ground floor fight. This allows skipping the entirety of Vermillion Tower up to the last fight before the boss

## Meteor Shade Wasteland:
- Locks Vermillion Wasteland Tunnel behind a Meteor Shade barrier.

## Open Faj'ro Temple:
- Enables a few extra passages on Upper Faj'ro Temple to make it less linear. This means most puzzles can be done in reverse order to access certain locations in reverse.
  This includes:
* F4 South Corridor has no doors locked (you can access Test of Surprise or Test of Memory earlier)
* F4 East Corridor can now be done in reverse
* F4 Gateway side doors are now accesible from the top floor
* F4 East Pathway can now be solved from both sides (from the bottom side, you have to solve the puzzle in reverse to exit up)
* F3 Test of Wisdom can now be accessed from F3 Bottom Chamber. This means to access F4 East Corridor through F3 Right Chamber, you have to solve the puzzle in reverse
