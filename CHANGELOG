# Fajro Temple:

No logout or party member lock after Faj’ro temple
Disabled the cutscene when you enter the cross room in ground floor
Removed the movement from cutscene when you enter Cold Room so people dont get softlock by entering from different entrances

Sapphire Ridge entrance is not locked anymore until post-kryskajo events
Gaias Garden entrance is not locked anymore until post-vermillion events

Chief’s House entrance area not locked
Chief’s House inside locked so you dont go down for stick quest

# Keys / Dungeons / Expo Spaces:

No race tracking for dungeons
End cutscenes not tied to having party members
Thief Key and White Key fights entrance barrier not locked when you finish fight (but the exit still requires getting the new key chest for logic reasons)
Expo space maps not tied to plot.line but to dungeon completion
Dungeons will have less key usage so spare keys lead to easier/faster traversal for randomizers (less need to gather that many keys)

# Quests

Subsequent quests in factions, are now unlocked depending on shades, rather than dungeon / plot completion


# DLC

DLC areas are active by default when DLC is active (Beach, Homestedt, Upgraded shops and North of Rhombus Square, and Ku'lero Dungeon)

==========================================================================================

## EXTRA PATCHES

You can activate these patches from the Randomizer menu in CCItemRandomizer, or through the .yaml settings in the CCMultiworldRandomizer

# Vermillion Tower Shade and Boss lock:

- A condition that locks Vermillion Tower entrance until you get all 4 element shades (Azure Drop, Purple Bolt, Blue Ice, and Red Flame Shades), and beaten the 4 element dungeons (Mine, Faj'ro, So'najiz and Zir'vitar). You can also make the condition only require the bosses, or the shades.

# Vermillion Tower floor skips:

- Enables all Tower floors once you finish the ground floor fight. This allows skipping the entirety of Vermillion Tower up to the last fight before the boss.

# Meteor Shade Wasteland:

- Locks Vermillion Wasteland Tunnel behind a Meteor Shade barrier.

# Open Faj'ro Temple:

- Enables a few extra passages on Upper Faj'ro Temple to make it less linear. This means most puzzles must be done in reverse order to access certain locations in reverse.
  This includes:

* F4 South Corridor has no doors locked (you can access Test of Surprise or Test of Memory earlier)
* F4 East Corridor can now be done in reverse
* F4 Gateway side doors are now accesible from the top floor
* F4 East Pathway can now be solved from both sides (from the bottom side, you have to solve the puzzle in reverse to exit up)
* F3 Test of Wisdom can now be accessed from F3 Bottom Chamber. This means to access F4 East Corridor through F3 Right Chamber, you have to solve the puzzle in reverse
